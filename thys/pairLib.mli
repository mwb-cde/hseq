   pairLib.mli:

   Support code for pairScript.ml.

   Adds a pretty printer for pair terms.
   This prints [pair a b] as [a, b] rather than the standard printer
   which produces [a , b] (with an extra space before the comma).

   The standard parser handles commas correctly.

   compile with
        ocamlc -c -I INCLUDEDIR pairLib.mli
   where INCLUDEDIR is the directory containing the hseq header files.
