HSeq Theorem Prover

==============

HSeq is a tactical theorem prover for typed higher-order logic.  HSeq
is experimental, alpha-quality code which may have soundness bugs.

HSeq is distributed under the terms of the BSD License, see file
COPYRIGHT for details.

Requirements: OCaml 3.09 
Building HSeq requires GNU Make in a Unix environment.

For installation instructions, see file INSTALL.

To start HSeq as a toplevel, run 'hseq'.

To run HSeq on script n, run 'hseqb n'.

The system looks in the installation directory for the libraries and
theories needed for execution. If the environment variable HSEQ is
set, it is used as the name of the installation directory.

Some documentation is provided in directories doc/html or doc/info
(for html or texinfo format). Quick-start documentation is in
doc/html/quickstart. It's recommended that the source code
documentation is built and installed (see file INSTALL).

Files
=====

The system builds as a theorem prover library and an interface to the
OCaml toplevel. 

Programs:
---------

hseq: The interactive theorem prover.
hseqb <file>: Run the theorem prover on script <file>
hseqc <file>: Compile script <file> against the HSeq libraries.

Use option --help with hseqb and hseqc for all options.

Libraries:
----------

The library is named hseq.cma and depends on the OCaml libraries Nums
and Unix. The library is built by packing the code into a module named
HSeq.  The library should be opened, with 'open HSeq', and initialized
before it is used, by calling Global.init().

File-handling is handled by two hooks: Global.Hooks.load_file and
Global.Hooks.use_file. Hook load_file is used to load byte-code files,
hook use_file is used to use script files.

The library does not depend on the toplevel interface. Using the
library without the toplevel hasn't been tested.

Module Init has more initialization code that may be useful.  File
examples/libtest.ml is a very simple example of using the library to
build a stand-alone executable.

Toplevel:
---------

The toplevel interface is made up of libraries tpquote.cma
and hseqtop.cma.  Library tpquote.cma is the quotation expander and
hseqtop.cma is the main toplevel code, mainly to initialize the
system.

Linking:
--------

If the toplevel is not needed, program hseqc can be used to handle
compiling a file against the HSeq libraries. (options --verbose or
--info will print the command line passed to the ocamlc compilers).

Building a toplevel done with the OCaml tools and the HSeq libraries.
The order in which libraries are linked is significant: library hseq
which must come before hseqtop. The quotation expander is used with
camlp4.

The link order used to build the standard toplevel is:
   nums.cma unix.cma camlp4.o.cma pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo
   hseq.cma tpquote.cma hseqtop.cma

It should be possible to link with the HSeq library in the sequence
   nums.cma unix.cma hseq.cma
