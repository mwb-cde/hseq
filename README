==============================

HSeq is a tactical theorem prover for typed higher-order logic.  It
should be considered experimental, alpha-quality code.

HSeq is distributed under the terms of the BSD License, see file
COPYRIGHT for details.

Requirements: OCaml 3.09 
Building HSeq also requires GNU Make in a Unix environment.

For installation instructions, see file INSTALL.

To start HSeq, run 'hseq'.

The system looks in the installation directory for the libraries and
theories needed for execution. If the environment variable HSEQ is
set, the value of HSEQ is used as the name of the installation
directory.

Some documentation is provided in directories doc/html or doc/info
(for html or texinfo format). It is recommended that the source code
documentation is built and installed (see file INSTALL).
