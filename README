For installation instructions, see file INSTALL.

The system builds as a theorem prover library and an interface to the
OCaml toplevel. 

Programs:
---------

hseq         - The interactive theorem prover.
hseqb <file> - Run the theorem prover on script <file>
hseqc <file> - Compile script <file> against the HSeq libraries.

To start HSeq as a toplevel, run 'hseq'.
To run HSeq on script n, run 'hseqb n'.

Use option --help with hseqb and hseqc for all options.

Documentation:
