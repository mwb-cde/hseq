Installation
============

Requirements: 
	OCaml version 3.09
	GNU make
	A Unix-like environment (specifically: Unix file tools)

From the toplevel directory: 
1) Run the configuration script:
	ocaml configure.ml
   By default, this set the installation directory to /usr/local/lib/hseq.

   Options can be passed to the configure script. 
	--help: See the list of options and their default values.
	--basedir: Set the installation directory
	--bindir: Set the directory in which to install the binary

   Examples:
	ocaml configure.ml --help,

	ocaml configure.ml --bindir /usr/local/bin
	(put the binary in /usr/local/bin)

	ocaml configure.ml --basedir `pwd`
	(make the installation directory the same as the build directory)


2) Build the system:
	make

3) Install the system:
	make install

4) Build and install documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-doc

5) Build and install source code documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-srcdoc

6) Clean up
	make clean


AFTER INSTALLATION
==================

The binary is named "hseq" and can be moved to a different location,
such as a directory in the system path.

The installation directory can be changed after the system is built
provided the environment variable "HSEQ" is set to the new directory.


NON-UNIX BUILD
==============

Building on non-Unix systems is not supported. However, os-neutral
file tools, which rely only on OCaml, are provided and can be
used. These are in file config/filetools.ml

THE FILE TOOLS IN filetools.ml MAY CAUSE SIGNIFCIANT DAMAGE TO YOUR
FILES AND/OR FILESYSTEM.

To build with the os-neutral file tools, follow the instructions above
for the Unix but also pass the option --toolbox to the configuration
script.

   Examples:
	ocaml configure.ml --bindir /usr/local/bin --toolbox
	(put the binary in /usr/local/bin, 
	use the os-neutral file tools)

	ocaml configure.ml --basedir `pwd` --toolbox
	(make the installation directory the same as the build directory,
	use the os-neutral file tools))

When building with filetools.ml, the installation directory must be
different from the build directory.

Building with the os-neutral file tools will fail to generate the
html/info documentation. 

It may also fail to build the theory files. In this case, go to the
thys directory, run HSeq as:
	../src/hseq -I ../src/lib -I ../src
and build the theories manually,
	#use "buildall.ml"
then continue with the install
	make install
