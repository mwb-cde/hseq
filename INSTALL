Installation
============

Requirements: 
  OCaml version 3.09
  GNU make
  A Unix-like environment (specifically: the file tools cp, mkdir and rm)

From the toplevel directory: 
1) Run the configuration script:
	ocaml configure.ml
   By default, this set the installation directory to /usr/local/lib/hseq.

   Options can be passed to the configure script. 
	--help: See the list of options and their default values.
	--basedir: Set the installation directory
	--bindir: Set the directory in which to install the binary

   Examples:
	ocaml configure.ml --help,

	ocaml configure.ml --bindir /usr/local/bin
	(put the binary in /usr/local/bin)

	ocaml configure.ml --basedir `pwd`
	(make the installation directory the same as the build directory)


2) Build the system:
	make

3) Install the system:
	make install

4) Build and install documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-doc

5) Build and install source code documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-srcdoc

6) Clean up
	make clean


AFTER INSTALLATION
==================

The binary is named "hseq" and can be moved to a different location,
such as a directory in the system path.

The installation directory can be changed after the system is built
provided the environment variable "HSEQ" is set to the new directory.


NON-UNIX BUILD
==============

Building on non-Unix systems is not supported. However, only the Unix
file tools (cp, rm and mkdir) are required. If these are present then
the system should build. 

Building the documentation also requires the GNU Texinfo system.
