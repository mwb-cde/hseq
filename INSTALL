Installation
============

Requirements: 
  OCaml version 3.11

To build:
  GNU Make on Unix 

Build:
------

From the toplevel directory: 
1) Run the configuration script:
	ocaml configure.ml

   This generates files config/data.make and config/configure.data

   Options for configure.ml:
	--help:      See the list of options and their default values.
	--basedir d: Set the installation directory to d
                     default:/usr/local/lib/hseq
	--bindir d:  Install the binary in directory d
        --fast (true/false): 
                     Use the fast byte-code compiler (ocamlc.opt)
                     default:false (use ocamlc)

   Examples:
	ocaml configure.ml --help,

	ocaml configure.ml --bindir /usr/local/bin
	(put the binary in /usr/local/bin)

	ocaml configure.ml --fast true --basedir `pwd` 
	(make the installation directory the same as the build directory
	and use the fast compilers)

2) Build the system:
	make

3) Install the system:
	make install

4) Build and install documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-doc

5) Build and install source code documentation (optional, recommended)
	make install-srcdoc

6) Clean up
	make clean


Notes:
------

Building the documentation requires the GNU Texinfo system.

Filenames with spaces should be passed to the configure.ml script as
a string. For example, /a/b c/d should be passed as "/a/b c/d"

AFTER INSTALLATION
==================

The binary is named "hseq" and can be moved to a different location,
such as a directory in the system path.

The installation directory can be changed after the system is built
provided the environment variable "HSEQ" is set to the new directory.
