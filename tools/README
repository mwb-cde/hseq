Tools for use with the hseq system.

configure.ml: 

Generate a configuration data file from command line arguments. 
Emit definitions suitable for use in a makefile and definitions
for use with pa_macro.cmo.

A configuration file called "configure.data" is needed in directory
config, before the system can be compiled. Running configure.ml will
generate a file with sane (for unix) defaults. See note at top of
configure.ml for options.


hseqc: 

Executes scripts with hseq from the command line. `hseqc f` is
equivalent to `hseq -I DIR f` (where HSEQDIR is the include directory
for hseq).

Build notes:

Programs depend on configure.data in the config directory.
