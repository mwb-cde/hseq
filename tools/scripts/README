Tools for use with the hseq system.

hseqc: 

Executes scripts with hseq from the command line. `hseqc f` is
equivalent to `hseq -I DIR f` (where HSEQDIR is the include directory
for hseq).

hseqb:

Run HSeq in batch-mode, to build theories from the command line.

Build notes:

Programs depend on configure.data in the toplevel directory.
