HSeq 
----------

+ Added executable hseqb to handle scripts.

+ Split the system into a library and toplevel part.
  Library named hseq.
  Toplevel made up of tpquote.cma (the quotation expander),
  and hseqtop.cma (the interface to the OCaml toplevel).

+ Added induction tactics induct_tac and induct_on
	
* Fixed soundness bug in rewriter and simplifier. Matching function
  Unify.matches_rewrite succeeded when it should have failed.
